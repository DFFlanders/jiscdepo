= Project Overview =
  * *Full Name of Project*: Modus Operandi for Repository Deposits
    * *Project Tag*: DepositMO) <- aka "MO" = "Microsoft Office"
  * *Project Descriptions* (how would you describe this project to your neighbour?):
    * *short*: Changing the culture, embedding deposit into the natural everyday workflow of researchers and lecturers.
    * *long*: Deposit MO will extend the widely used Microsoft Office suite to enable seamless interaction with repositories to improve deposit usage. Through the production and/or usage of existing standards, DepositMO will produce a specification for the direct interaction between the desktop and various repository environments. Extending this further it is envisioned that this functionality also be available via the native operating system itself (e.g. via a right click menu). DepositMO therefore extends to all authors and data producers both in the UK and worldwide. Within the scope of the project we will be targeting two repository architectures, EPrints and DSpace, and using SWORD and ORE protocols we ensure interoperability
and sustainability in the long‐term.
    * *problem it solves?*:

    # Integrated desktop tools for easy submission 
    # Specification for interactive deposit, applicable for both client and server
