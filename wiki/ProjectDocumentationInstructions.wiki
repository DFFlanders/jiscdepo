= Introduction to Project Documentation =
All JISC projects are *required* to complete documentation.  While documentation can be laborious, it is important to view documentation as the way the story of your project can be told to others!  Documentation is there to help *spread good practice amongst our community* and to help you to *effectively plan the work you want to achieve*. For the jiscDEPO projects we have attempted to scope all documentation so you can directly see the benefits that documentation has for yourself and for the community as a whole.

It is worth noting that jiscLMS projects are utilising a new and different style of documentation that is lightweight, open and web-worthy.  Overall we hope the following documentation gets you writing stories for one another as a community, rather than just to the JISC Executive.  We hope to achieve this by having every project use a blog as their primary start-up system so that they can update one another on the progress as they make it.  Once you have achieved your final project output(s) we would then encourage you to launch an official website at the end of your project ([http://www.curtismchale.ca/business/early-site-launch/ don't launch early!]).  Until then, just get as many thoughts, ideas and win/fail posts up as possible.  And most importantly get cracking on the project!

Below is a list of documentation you will need to complete so as to fulfil your remit to the jiscDEPO programme-strand.

= jiscDEPO Project Documentation =
_*There are three sets of documents you are required to complete during the course of your jiscDEPO project, of which the project blog is the main documentation output:*_

  # [http://code.google.com/p/jisclms/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Core_Project_Resources_Form Core Project Resources Form]: A list of all core project contact information and resources.
  # [http://code.google.com/p/jisclms/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Project_Blog Project Blog]: The primary website for all ongoing project start-up work.
    * [http://code.google.com/p/jisclms/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Project_Plan_Posts Project Plan Posts]: 7 posts copy/pasted (and shortened) from your project bid outlining your project plan.
    * [http://code.google.com/p/jisclms/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Progress_Posts Progress Posts]: a minimum of one post per month should be posted with appropriate tags.
    * [http://code.google.com/p/jisclms/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Final_Product_Post Final Product Post]: this post lists the final output and product delivered by the project.
  # [http://code.google.com/p/jisclms/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Final_Project_Sign-Off Final Project Budget and Sign-Off Form]: Your final spend budget and an survey to get your overall impression of the jiscLMS programme.

Instructions and templates for these three sets of documentation are detailed below.

*_Please remember all documents you create as part of your project are subject to FOI so best to maintain best practice with regards to transparency and openness throughout your project_*

== Core Project Resources Form ==
  # http://www... <- please fill out this form within the first fortnight of the project.
    * This form is gathering the key contact details and resources in your project so that JISC can support you as effectively as possible in monitoring your project.  
    * For example by having all the project blog feeds we can aggregate them into a central feed so we can more effectively pass on news and developments as they occur to other JISC projects.  
    * This form must be kept up to date throughout the duration of the project and should be updated at the following link if any changes occur: http://bit.ly/9TrqSB 

== Project Blog ==
  * So as to make your life easier we are suggesting a series of blog posts be written for the project as it progresses.
  * The posts are intended to disseminate the knowledge of the project in the now, rather than waiting until the end of the project to share your experiences. 
  * In short, we would like you to write a blog post on the following themes during the course of your project, though you are welcome to find variance in the theme as you see fit.  We are not prescriptive here and really want you to write something that people in the community will want to read, i.e. don't write them for JISC Exec alone.
  * Please make sure to use the correct tags for each post (including your own project tag) so that our robots can come along and aggregate all posts on various topics into our analytics tools (manyEyes, Google Data, etc).  We are hoping this open data approach helps increase the synchronous-ability in which we communicate with one another.
  * The posts can be as short or as long as you like just make sure to keep your fellow projects and Higher Education community audience in mind.  
  * You must cover all the topic themes (and use all the tags) below: be that in ten separate posts or in three or four longer posts (though our preference is for early and often where possible).

=== Project Plan Posts ===

To get your project blog started we suggest you publish your project plan as a series of project blog posts.  This should be an easy task as you should be copying and pasting your project bid into the following categories (please shorten as much as possible so it is easy to read for anyone who might encounter it on the Web).

|| *Project Plan Posts* || *Description / Example* || *Required Tags* ||
|| Project Plan Post 1 of 7: Aims, Objectives and Final Output(s) of the project || This post should clearly list the overall project aim, the objectives that will support that aim and what outputs will be achieved by the end of the project. || "projectPlan", "aim", "objectives", "outputs", "yourUniqueProjectTag", jiscDEPO, jisc ||
|| Project Plan Post 2 of 7 Wider Benefits to Sector & Achievements for Host Institution || JISC projects are often a compromise between benefit to the local institution and the wider University sector.  The best projects are able to find a common middle ground that achieve both.  How are you going to achieve success both for your local institution and the wider community? || "projectPlan", "institutionalBenefits, "communityBenefits", "yourUniqueProjectTag", jiscDEPO, jisc ||
|| Project Plan Post 3 of 7: Risk Analysis and Success Plan || This post should attempt to forecast both the risks or hurdles that might arise as the project progresses as well as how the project will manage sucess if its outputs are popular and questions come flooding in? || "projectPlan", "riskAnalysis", "successPlan", "yourUniqueProjectTag", jiscDEPO, jisc ||
|| Project Plan Post 4 of 7: IPR (Creative Commons Use & Open Source Software License) || This post should clearly state what licenses will be applied to all work and outputs throughout the course of the project, most importantly this post can then act as a default link to add to other project web pages (blog sidebar nav) so IPR is clearly stated and displayed (don't forget the links to the license text and logo) || "projectPlan", "copyright", "IPR", "license", "yourUniqueProjectTag", jiscDEPO, jisc ||
|| Project Plan Post 5 of 7: Project Team Relationships and End User Engagement. || This post should explain who is on the project team and what responsibilities they have, also information on how engagement with end users will be achieved should be included. || "projectPlan", "projectTeam", "users", "yourUniqueProjectTag", jiscDEPO, jisc ||
|| Project Plan Post 6 of 7: Projected Timeline, Workplan & Overall Project Methodology || A suggested timeline (e.g. gannt or burndown chart should be listed) along with projected workpackages for the project completion.  Also an overall methodology (e.g. Six Sigma, Agile, Scrum, etc) for how the project deliverables will be achieved should be stated. || "projectPlan", "timeline", "projectMethodology", "yourUniqueProjectTag", jiscDEPO, jisc ||
|| Project Plan Post 7 of 7: Budget || This initial project budget should be a forecast for future spending along with a justification for why the money should be spent this way, we realise this will change over the course of the project.  Please do not reveal any personal details in the budget.  Use 'central spine' job titles and costing to reveal staff costs || "projectPlan", "budget", "yourUniqueProjectTag", jiscDEPO, jisc ||

=== Progress Posts ===

The following topics make up some of the suggested Progress Posts (you can do these posts in the order you see as most pragmatic to your project).  MAKE SURE TO USE REQUIRED TAGS where appropriate.

|| * Suggested Progress Post Topics* || *Description / Example* || *Required Tags* ||
|| "Project Evaluation" aka iterative reflection || Undertake a quick iterative evaluation process, aka something that can be done when you are waiting for public transport ro a good way to kick off a meeting (e.g.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis SWOT analysis]).  The key is to truly knowing thyself or at least your project. || "SWOT", "projectEvaluation", "jiscLMS", "progressPost", "JISC", "[yourUniqueProjectTag]", etc. ||
|| "User participation" aka use cases || What is the core user case(s) you think of when developing; how has this story changed as you have engaged with the end user e.g. "we often talk about Sam the part time working student we met while at...".  Bonus points for actually talking about real end-users you are working with (note: you are not the end user!) || "userCase", "endUser", "jiscLMS", "progressPost", "JISC", "[yourUniqueProjectTag]", etc. ||
|| "Day-to-day work" aka tools, tips and trick that make you productive || What software tools or productivity methods do you use and how do you use them?  How do they make you more productive and why do you see value in using them?  Any and all tools, methodologies or diagrams showing off the way your project is run from an individual or team perspective are welcome. || "methodology", "implementation", "productivity", "progressPosts", "jiscLMS", "JISC", "[yourUniqueProjectTag]", etc. ||
|| "Technical standards" aka stuff you reuse || What technologies, frameworks, standards or anything else that makes your life easier (or harder) in your work.  For example: what programming language (or framework, IDE, pattern, etc) do you use and why do you love it, e.g. "why I love Object Relational Mapping in Python and Django" or "why I think SWORD is great but could do this...", please remember to provide links for standards and acronyms, etc. || "techStandards", "technicalDevelopment", "progressPosts", "jiscLMS", "JISC", "[yourUniqueProjectTag]", etc. ||
|| "Value Add" aka what shifted your thinking in a new direction || What was the most important thing you discovered that brought value to your project, e.g. what was the deciding factor that made you make a specific decision on a what technology, process or human process you were going to use? ||  "valueAdd", "disruptiveInnovation", "progressPosts", "jiscLMS", "JISC", "[yourUniqueProjectTag]", etc. ||
|| "Small WIN(s") & "FAIL(s)"* aka advice others could benefit from ||  Announce small wins for the project, e.g. when you finish a coding sprint or when a user has a 'wow your software is cool' moment.  The more of these short "win" posts the better!  Also don't forget to post the FAIL(s) as well: telling people where things went wrong so they don't repeat mistakes is priceless for a thriving community. || "WIN" or "FAIL", "progressPosts", "jiscLMS", "JISC", "[yourUniqueProjectTag]", etc. ||
