= Project Overview =
  * *Full Name of Project*:RePosit: positing a new kind of deposit 
    * *Project Tag*:reposit 
  * *Project Descriptions* (how would you describe this project to your neighbour?):
    * *short*: >Finding and overcoming the barriers to deposit using a remote interface, through investigation, training and advocacy.
    * *long*: The RePosit project is a collaboration between 5 HEIs all of whom use or are in the process of migrating to using a publications management system as a primary deposit interface to their digital repositories. The aim is to encourage engagement by researchers and increase the uptake of this interface within each institution. Training and support materials will be developed and will be available to the community as a whole, which are of value to all HEIs in this situation irrespective of the software that they use. The project will begin with a review of existing strategies for increasing uptake based on previous JISC projects, and move on to the development and implementation of advocacy programmes and training materials for workshops at the partner institutions, to both enhance the repository and validate the approaches decided upon. The project will evaluate its success by comparing before-and-after statistics for the repository content, by examining the potential number of deposits from the publications management system, and by soliciting feedback from the users as to the effectiveness of the software and the training approaches, which will then be disseminated to the wider deposit community.
