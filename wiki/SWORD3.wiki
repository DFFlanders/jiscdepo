    # SWORD website will be updated with step-by-step instructional documentation for how various key stakeholders can learn about and engage with SWORD (walk-throughs for repository managers and developers at a minimum) <-- this will be achieved through the workshop and plugfest that Stuart and Adrian will put on at OR10 so that we know the documentation works in the real world.
    # an A4 glossy giving a high-level overview of 'what is SWORD' that anyone in HEIs can understand and digest so as to understand the value that SWORD bring to the community and institution.
    # A whitepaper describing how SWORD could be advanced, via modularisations (in the form of IETF RfC paper) so that full APP can be implemented with CRUD methods installed atop repository workflows.
    # Ongoing community news updates via SWORD Blog or Listserv.
