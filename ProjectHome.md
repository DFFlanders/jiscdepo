# What is this website and who is it for? #
This website is an overview of the JISC projects currently taking place in the jiscDEPO programme.  "jiscDEPO" represents two things: (1) the ["Joint Information Systems Committee" (JISC)](http://www.jisc.ac.uk) which is the funding organisation behind this set of projects, and (2) "DEPOsit" of research cotent online and in the open.  Please see the sidebar links for the history and context for these set of projects.

_DISCLAIMER: This site is not an official JISC site but rather the notebook for the jiscDEPO Programme Manager to keep track of the various projects taking place within this programme; essentially it is another project in the jiscDEPO programme that tracks the activity of all the projects._ For the official JISC page on #jiscDEPO please see the official JISC website:

# jiscDEPO projects: "embedding deposit solutions to get research content online" #
The jiscDEPO projects were funded in June of 2010 (they will run for up to one year, til July 2011).  These projects represent the significant number of online research repositories in the UK that are actively collecting research content.

Each project funded is tasked with the following:

  * (i) assemble tools, processes and support to create an effective deposit solution that leads to an ongoing, significant increase in the rate of deposit, and is easily used by researchers or support staff, adds value and enhances research practice and/or management. Examples of tools, processes and support are given in the Briefing Paper. Existing work should be built on wherever possible, though it may need to be developed further or configured to meet project needs.
  * (ii) develop and test the solution in at least two authentic settings at the institutional and/or research community level as appropriate, for example by developing or configuring deposit tools, processes and support specific to individual research community needs, or by supporting the institution’s compliance with funder mandate policies.
  * (iii) ensure that each deposited research output has a stable URI.
  * (iv) establish and maintain a publicly accessible analytics engine that will display the total number of deposits achieved during and after the life of the project for each repository used (please see the Briefing Paper for further details)
  * (v) undertake the above in such a way as to allow the project to draft a practical action plan that would lead to wide and sustained adoption of the solution and to a significant, sustainable and sector-wide increase in the rate of deposit of Open Access research outputs into repositories. These projects should lead to solutions that can easily be adopted by other institutions. At this point in time JISC cannot commit to any further funding to support the adoption of the project solutions. However the results of these projects have the potential to address important strategic objectives for Open Access and therefore JISC will consider the results of this programme in its future planning.
  * (vi) engage as appropriate with researchers, research organisations, managers, institutional management support bodies, research funders, publishers, developer communities and support bodies. Projects will also be expected to engage in programme level activity and contribute to case studies, as described in the briefing paper. This engagement will need to be resourced from project funds.
Projects will do their uptmost to engage the wider UK higher education community so that the work will enable other institutions to take advantage of the outputs and experiences.

The projects funded represent a balanced portfolio of work.  Total spending on these projects by the JISC was £750K.

# FAQ #
These set of questions help define how the collection of these projects (funded under the "jiscDEPO" strand of work) are defined and more widely disseminated.

  * Q1. How are the jiscDEPO projects (as a collective) changing the sector?
    * The intention of the jiscDEPO projects is to provide a set of successful solutions (both processes and tools) that will inform the entire sector on how deposit of research content can be embedded and maintained so as to insure a steady and consistent rate of deposit.
      * The primary focus of this programme is the four institutional projects ([jiscdura](jiscdura.md), [reposit](reposit.md) and [depositmo](depositmo.md)), who are working hand in hand with real world research communities to provide both human support (such as on-call and face-to-face support), as well as technical solutions (such as desktop tools for researchers) to use in their day-to-day research activity.
      * To support the institutional projects there are two deposit infrastructure projects ([OARJ](OARJ.md) and [swordv2](swordv2.md)) which are providing a common set of deposit tools that all projects accross the University sector can use to support their deposit process and tools.
      * Finally, is the synthesis project for this work ([sonex](sonex.md)) which is collecting deposit use cases both from the jiscDEPO projects as well as from the international scholarly community so that deposit solutions can continue to adapt and change as the Web itself continues to change.

  * Q2. If the jiscDEPO projects are going to change the sector, how will we notice when change occurs?
    * The quantitative means for monitoring the projects will be via the analytics engine that each project is required to have so as to monitor deposit rate and hit rate.  Projects will be evaluated according to the number of deposits they can achieve in a sustainable manner.  The quantitative measures will support the in depth qualitative measures which is primary focus for evaluating projects.
    * The qualitative monitoring of projects will be via a three step process for revealing (aka "synthesising") the significant themes and overall deliverables of all the projects (i.e. defining what the sum of their parts equals):
      * The Programme Manager will go on a SiteVisit to see each project, this happens after the [Project Plan Posts](http://code.google.com/p/jiscdepo/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Project_Plan_Posts) have been published and the [DOAP form](http://code.google.com/p/jiscdepo/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Description_of_a_Project_(DOAP)_form) filled out in full.
      * Each jiscDEPO project is required to have a [project blog](http://code.google.com/p/jiscdepo/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Project_Blog) which will be monitored by the Programme Manager (see [jiscDEPO Blog Planet](http://code.google.com/p/jiscdepo/#jiscDEPO_project_blog_planet)).  The Programme Manager will provide a quarterly report (see StrandUpdates) on the significant themes and patterns emerging from the jiscDEPO projects as a whole.
      * The [Final Sign-off Survey](http://code.google.com/p/jiscdepo/wiki/ProjectDocumentationInstructions#Final_Project_Sign-Off) will be evaluated by the Programme Manager and the overall INF11 Evaluation consultant to find out what other deliverables where achieved beyond the project outputs, e.g. what skills where gained, what failures were learned from and how the team has progressed in terms of their ability to innovate.

  * Q3. Who will read the things produced by jiscDEPO projects and help explain them to other stakeholders and the powers that be?
    * First and foremost it is the responsibility of the community to feedback on what their are noticing themselves in terms of sector change.  This is the purpose of having project reporting in the open via the project blogs and the collective feed of all project blogs (see [jiscEXPO Project Blog Planet](http://code.google.com/p/jiscdepo/#jiscDEPO_project_blog_planet))
    * In addition will be the Synthesis Liaison and Programme Manager who will actively monitor the overall Web environment to notice what changes are occurring and to document those changes in the StrandUpdates .
    * At the end of the jiscDEPO projects there will be a collective gathering of all the outputs from the project that will be turned into a "Research Deposit Information Pack" which will be a good-practice guide for any and all institution on how to establish and maintain an embedded deposit process.

  * Q4. Who are the most significant stakeholders (audiences) who will be affected by the change that come out of the jiscDEPO projects as a collective?
    * Overall the primary end user of this potential sector wide change is the researcher and their day to day research activity.  However, researcher have very little time to achieve a robust deposit strategy (nor should they be taken away from the research).  Rather the processes built into their deposit decisions must be beneficial and provide a positive feedback loop into their research process.  It is responsibility of the following groups of people to make the deposit process a lightweight and beneficial process for the end user, the researcher.
      * Librarians, Repository Managers, Repository Administrators, System Architects
        * Society of College, National and University Libraries http://www.sconul.ac.uk/
        * UK Council of Research Repositories http://www.ukcorr.org/
        * Repositories Support Project http://www.rsp.ac.uk/
        * Universities and Colleges Information Systems Association http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/
      * Researchers
        * Research Councils UK http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/

  * Q5. How will JISC gather information from the projects to help promote them and advertise them to the wider world?
    * The final outputs from the programme will be synthesised into a "Research Deposit Information Pack" which will be made avaialable to all stakeholders.
    * Each project should evaluate and provide a guide on their successes along with the potential opportunity for a common jiscDEPO end of programme event.
    * Further evaluation of the projects will take place by the JISC Executive to help inform further strategic work.

  * Q6. How will these projects and their outputs be reused and/or what sustainability models will be utilised to make the project last beyond the initial project funding?
    * It will be the achievements of the institutional projects in creating a sustainable deposit solution that will be the primary motivator for other institution to copy the successes that have been achieve.  The projects themselves will utilise their dissemination budgets to express to the wider community how they achieved their success and what were the critical success factors.
      * In addition to the jiscDEPO projects being held up as pathfinders for sustainable deposit, any reusable tools or processes discovered will be made available for reuse and repurposing.
    * The primary focus of all deposit work will be to embed the deposit solutions (processes or tools) into the long term institutional provision so that research is maintained in the long term.
      * Where there are potential business models for furthering the work that does not include re-newed JISC funding project will be encouraged to pursue their potential.
    * JISC will also evaluate these set of projects for the potential opportunity as shared service provision.
