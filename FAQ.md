  * Q: What is a Programme?
    * A: A 'Programme' is a collection or a set of 'Projects' (see diagram below), e.g. a programme is a meta-project (in object-oriented terms).
  * Q: What is a 'Programme-Strand'?
    * A: A 'strand' is a themed set of projects that are funded together, but are still apart of the larger overall Programme, e.g. there is usually one programme manager per strand, though many programme managers with multiple strands in a programme. (see diagram below)
  * Q: Why do you clump projects together?
    * A: So we can 'synthesise' (tell the bigger stories and share good practice), 'evaluate' (examine and guide the new ways forward for innovation) and 'realise benefits' (select the best of breed projects to further advance for the good of all).
  * Why do you use terms like 'programme', 'strand', 'sythesise', 'evaluate' and 'benefits realisation'?
    * A: Mostly so we can speak with other Programme Managers about what we are doing, but it does help projects understand how they are structured alongside other projects.
  * Q: I want to know more how JISC structures Programmes, Strands and Projects?
    * A: Really? - well we are tentatively based off a methodology called 'Managing Successful Programmes' as part of the PRINCE2 Framework, however speak with your Programme Manager to know more.
